<p>Anyone and everyone is welcome, regardless of skill level or knowledge of the game! Haven't ever seen a magic card but are curious how to play? Or maybe you're a constructed spike who grinds local tourneys on the daily? Regardless of who you are, we offer events to cater to everyone's different preferences and skills.

And, all of our events are 100% free to enter, often with a pretty sizable prize pool (that could be as big as a box of Modern Horizons!). We host monthly free drafts, free semester-long constructed leagues (with big prize pools and a champion's playmat), free pre-releases when new sets come out, and subsidized travel to MagicFests! We also encourage proxies at meetings so everyone can play any format they like!

Starting this year, we are starting a formal MTG Arena competitive team through our partnership with CU Gaming. This means the potential to represent CU on the stage of the biggest collegiate tournament! CU Gaming Jerseys will be provided to players. Tryout information will be posted soon after the start of the year.
